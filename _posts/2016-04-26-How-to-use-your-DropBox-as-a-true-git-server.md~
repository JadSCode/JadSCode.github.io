Today, I'm going to introduce https://github.com/anishathalye/git-remote-dropbox[git-remote-dropbox] , a tool that let you turn your DropBox into a real git server.

Maybe you are wondering why doing that, while there are a bunch of free services as bitbucket and others that offers unlimited private repositories ?

That's true, but wouldn't be good if we keep our regular files and codes together in one place :D ? All in One backup ! 

Some free services do limit the number of collaborators, so by using this tool, you can add as much as you want !

Let's start : 

- [*] Installing using https://pypi.python.org/pypi[PyPI]
[source] 
	pip install git-remote-dropbox.
    
- [*] Go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create[app console] in your DropBox account
- [*] Create a Dropbox API app with full access to all files and file types
- [*] Generate the OAuth 2 token and create a new file

[source,json]
{
    "token": "-----------"
}



- [*] Save it to ~/.git-remote-dropbox.json 





To clone repositories in folders mounted in your Dropbox, you can run:


[source]
git clone "dropbox://path/to/repo"


To add a remote to an existing local repository, you can run:

[source]
git remote add origin "dropbox://path/to/repo"



Enjoy :)
